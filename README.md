### Hi, I'm Yulee (이유리) 👋

- 🔭 I'm an undergraduate student at **Seoul National University (SNU)**, double-majoring in **Computer Science** and **Plant Production Science**.
- 🌱 I'm passionate about **Programming Languages (PL)**, **Compilers**, **Type Systems**, and low-level system design.
- 💡 My goal is to merge my knowledge in plant science with CS/AI to solve real-world problems in the Agri-Tech space.
- 💻 I'm currently learning backend development (using **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**) as a member of **Waffle Studio**, SNU's software development club.

### 🚀 My Pinned Projects

* **[m-polymorphic-type-system](https://github.com/colswap/m-polymorphic-type-system)**
    * An implementation of a let-polymorphic type checker in OCaml, based on the Hindley-Milner (Algorithm W).
* **[sm5-binary-translator](https://github.com/colswap/sm5-binary-translator)**
    * A binary translator (inspired by Apple's Rosetta) that converts SM5 VM bytecode to a target VM (Sonata) without a continuation stack.
* **[sm5-garbage-collector](https://github.com/colswap/sm5-garbage-collector)**
    * A Mark & Sweep Garbage Collector for a VM, using the S, M, E, and K (Continuation) stacks as GC roots.
* **[type-inference-treasure-island](https://github.com/colswap/type-inference-treasure-island)**
    * Solved an algorithmic puzzle by modeling it as a type-inference problem and implementing a unification algorithm in OCaml.
* **[k-to-sm5-compiler](https://github.com/colswap/k-to-sm5-compiler)**
    * A compiler that translates a high-level imperative language (K-*) into low-level stack machine (SM5) bytecode.
* **[cps-transformer](https://github.com/colswap/cps-transformer)**
    * A translator that converts a functional program into Continuation-Passing-Style (CPS) to make control flow explicit.

➡️ *...and 8 other projects on compilers, interpreters, and type systems!*
